In addition to the basic functions such as SUM and AVERAGE, I am proficient in organizing columns and sorting items from largest to smallest. I can also apply advanced functions and generate PivotTables for comprehensive data analysis. My skills with Excel include not just basic calculations, but also advanced data manipulation techniques. I can use functions like VLOOKUP, MATCH, IF, and SUMIF to handle complex datasets and derive meaningful insights.
